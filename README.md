# rocket-league-staller

A quick and easy way to stall in Rocket League on a Windows PC.

Simply run `Release/staller.exe`, then press the back mouse thumb button to perform a perfect stall!

### Disclaimer

This uses Rocket League's default keyboard binds to perform the stall, therefore if you've changed those binds, you'll need to rebuild this after you've updated the [virtual-key codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).
